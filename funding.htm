            <h1>Social Justice Alliance(SJA)</h1>
             <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3> Who is Social Justice Alliance?</h3>
               <p>Social Justice Alliance is a self-organized group for refugees in Hong Kong: run by refugees, for refugees. </p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Our background, mission and vision</h3>
                <p>The Social Justice Alliance began in 2015 following the Voices for Protection course organized by the Justice Centre to teach us about advocating for our rights as refugees.  We wanted to continue to meet and work as a group to support each other. We developed out of the vision of enjoying equal rights and opportunities, integrating and contributing to a good relationship between refugees and the Hong Kong community. </p>

                <p>We are seeking to change the perception of refugees in Hong Kong. The Social Justice Alliance wants Hong Kong people to see us as contributing members of the community. In order to do this, we are seeking to collaborate with the Hong Kong people. We desire to build relationships and learn.</p>
                <p>See more about us on our website:<a href="https://socialgroup.github.io/justice.github.io/index.html">SJA Website </a></p>
            <h3>Why support us?</h3>
                 <p>Refugees can be survivors of some of the most deplorable forms of human rights abuses, such as war, rape and various forms of persecution. We face particular vulnerabilities in Hong Kong. As we donâ€™t receive levels of assistance suitable to support an adequate standard of living, many are forced into poverty, deprivation and social exclusion. Many of us wait years for our claims to be processed by foreign governments and in the meantime we are not able to volunteer, work or join formal education. We want to be perceived as useful people who can contribute to the wellbeing of Hong Kong community. We want also to fight depression and stress caused by living in limbo by engaging in various social and cultural activities as well as educating ourselves. We want also to learn some useful skills that will help us once resettled to other countries. </p>
            <h3>Who is a refugee? </h3>
                 <p>A refugee is a person outside his/her country of nationality with a well-founded fear of persecution for any of the five following reasons: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. We cannot return home without risk of extreme violations of their human rights, including torture or even death.</p>
            <h3>Activities we need support for: </h3>
                <h4>1. SJA Meetings</h4>
                    <p>SJA meetings enable us to meet as a group, share stories, support each other, discuss and agree our plans and activities. It is something that group members look forward to and find very useful. Previously this was funded by the Justice Centre, but we are now looking for funding to help us. </p>
